  "statement_of_facts": "Plaintiff Thibodaux Properties, LLC ('Thibodaux') entered into a construction contract with Defendant Boudreaux Construction, Inc. ('Boudreaux') on March 8, 2025 for the renovation of a commercial property located at 4520 Government Street, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70806. The contract specified a total project cost of $485,000 with a completion date of October 1, 2025. Boudreaux abandoned the project approximately 60% complete on August 15, 2025, leaving exposed structural elements and incomplete electrical and plumbing work. Thibodaux served Interrogatories and Requests for Production on November 1, 2025, seeking financial records, subcontractor agreements, communications regarding the project, and documents evidencing the reasons for project abandonment. The 30-day response deadline under La. C.C.P. art. 1462 expired on December 1, 2025, with no responses received. Plaintiff's counsel sent a meet-and-confer letter on December 10, 2025, and a follow-up letter on January 5, 2026, both requesting compliance within 10 days. Defendant's counsel responded only to state that responses were 'forthcoming' but has produced nothing to date.",
